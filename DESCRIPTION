Description: Provides a simplified and robust interface for interacting with
    MinIO object storage from R. The package is built on top of the aws.s3
    package and adds additional layers of validation, asset verification,
    and safer error handling to improve reliability when working with
    object storage systems compatible with the S3 API. It is designed to
    reduce boilerplate code and common pitfalls when managing buckets,
    objects, and data assets in MinIO environments.
